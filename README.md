# ♟️ Chess Game Analysis using EDA, Pandas, NumPy & Plotly

Welcome to **Chess Game Analysis**, a data-driven project that leverages **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights and patterns in chess games using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `plotly`. This repository visualizes player behavior, win strategies, game durations, and more in an interactive and informative manner.

## 📊 About the Project

This project aims to:
- Analyze chess game records using data science techniques.
- Explore how player ratings, game duration, opening moves, and color advantage impact the outcome.
- Use interactive visualizations for better understanding of data.

Whether you're a chess lover or a data science enthusiast, this project provides an exciting intersection of strategy and statistics.

## 📈 Key Visualizations & Insights

Some key EDA plots and insights include:

- **Win distribution by color**  
  _Insight:_ White wins more often, but not significantly higher than black.

- **Top Opening Strategies**  
  _Insight:_ Players tend to favor King's Pawn and Queen's Gambit openings.

- **Game outcome vs rating difference**  
  _Insight:_ Higher rated players tend to win more, especially when rating difference > 200.

- **Distribution of game durations**  
  _Insight:_ Blitz games dominate in number but shorter games are more unpredictable.

- **Game termination types**  
  _Insight:_ Most games end with checkmate or resignation; timeouts are rare among high-rated players.

All charts are built using **Plotly** for interactive web-based exploration.
